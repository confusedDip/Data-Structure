# Data-Structure
3rd Semester DS Assignments

Assignment 1
____________
1. Write a method duplicate Stack that returns a new stack containing the same
elements and in the same order as the stack specified in the parameter. The
method should create a new stack and fill it with the same data elements as the
given stack. (You do not need to duplicate the contents of the elements.).
Before the method finishes, it must restore the contents of the original stack to
its original state (same contents in the same order).

2. Write a program to convert an infix expression of integers into its equivalent
postfix notation-using stack ADT.

3. Write a program to evaluate a postfix and prefix expression using a stack data
structure.

4. Write a program to implement three stacks ADT using one array.

5. Use your stack to check whether a String is a Palindrome or not.

6. Sort the given set of elements present in three stack data structures and put
them in a single stack, without using any other variable.
